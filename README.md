# rebalancer
Calculator for rebalancing a fund portfolio

Rebalancing is the process of realigning the weightings of a portfolio of assets. Rebalancing involves periodically buying or selling assets in a portfolio to maintain an original desired level of asset allocation.

This tool calculates how much to buy or sell from each bucket of funds based on the current market value and how much you have to invest.
